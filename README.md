# nr1-community

![GitHub release (latest SemVer including pre-releases)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/newrelic/nr1-community?include_prereleases&sort=semver) [![Snyk](https://snyk.io/test/github/newrelic/nr1-community/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/github/newrelic/nr1-community)

A community-driven library of useful components for building on New Relic One's programmability platform.

This library is built on top of and requires the 'nr1' core library available to Nerdpacks as part of running inside of the New Relic One platform, documentation on this underlying library can be found on [our developer site](https://developer.newrelic.com/client-side-sdk/index.html)

## Usage

Install in your project:

```bash
npm install --save @newrelic/nr1-community
```

Import the component/utils into your nerdlet:

```js
import { DetailPanel, EmptyState, Timeline, NerdGraphError, timeRangeToNrql } from 'nr1-community';
```

Import styles into your styles.scss (or similar):

```sass
@import '~@newrelic/nr1-community/dist/index.css'
```

## Components

For complete documentation and a demo, please visit [Demo](demo/README.md) and follow the instructions for viewing.

## Local Development

The `/demo` folder of this project is a Nerdpack that references the local copy of the components. You are able to develop the components and see how they function in a live environment as you develop them!

1. Open two terminals, navigate both to the root of this repository
2. In one, start up the demo site with the following commands ([Full Demo Info](demo/README.md))

```sh
  cd demo
  npm install
  nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf # Only needed the first time
  npm start
```

3. In the other, navigate to the root of this repository and run:

```sh
  npm install
  npm start
```

> Note: You're running `npm install` twice, once for nr1-community and once for the /demo Nerdpack.

Our bundler will watch for changes in /src and auto-build the library. The Demo Nerdpack will see these changes and perform its own live-reloading, referencing the local copy of the library.

## How do I add my component?

### Add to component library

1. Fork this repository
1. Create a new folder under `src/components` or `src/utils` with the name of your component (subject to review)
    1. Create a `index.js` so that the full path looks like `src/components/<name of component>/index.js`
    1. Create a `README.md` that will serve as the primary documentation for your component
    1. Create a `meta.json` and define the props your component requires/accepts
1. Export your component by adding an export line: `export { <name of component> } from './<name of component>';` to `src/components/index.js` or `src/utils/index.js`

### Add to demo/examples

Our goal here is to aggregate helpful information from your component, like the `README.md` and the `meta.json` (as some structured documentation of the component) alongside live code examples. We aim to keep each component's page as similar as possible and have a pattern we'd like you to follow, the easiest approach is to reference an existing one, but if you have troubles, open a pull-request as-is and we're happy to assist.

1. Create a new "page" (folder) in our demo Nerdpack under `<location-of-repo>/demo/nerdlets/nr1-community-demo-nerdlet/pages`. See existing components for a pattern to follow.
1. Your component's folder should contain the following:
    1. An `index.js`
    1. An `/examples` directory
1. Export your component's page in `<location-of-repo>/demo/nerdlets/nr1-community-demo-nerdlet/pages/index.js` like: `export { default as FooComponent } from './FooComponent';`
1. Add your component to the "page list" in `<location-of-repo>/demo/nerdlets/nr1-community-demo-nerdlet/index.js`

> Note: You'll notice us referencing the local components with the `@`, this isn't new JS magic. We've extended the typical Nerdpack's webpack config with an alias `@` for the "src" folder of the library to make imports a little less painful.
